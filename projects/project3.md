### Project 3

In this project, you'll be simulating a realistic workflow to refactor your previous BikeShare project using Git. Here's an overview of your tasks for this project.

**Set Up Your Repository**

First, fork a repository to get your own copy of a template for this project, and then clone it to your local computer. Your first task will then be to add your bikeshare.py file, data file, and a .gitignore file to exclude your data file from version control tracking. This is a common practice to avoid sharing your data publicly, to avoid tracking unnecessarily huge files on GitHub, and because changes in data don't often affect our code.

**Improve Documentation**

Next, you'll practice creating branches using Git to make some changes to your project. In the real world, it's common to use different branches to manage the development of separate features or changes to a project. 

Branches:
- Documentation
   - Add a README file
   - Improve docstrings in bikeshare.py file
  

**Refactor Code**

The next branch you'll be working on will be refactoring. Here, you can modify your bikeshare.py file to make improvements to the efficiency or readability of your code. You'll practice committing your code as you work on it, with _at least three commits on this branch with meaningful messages_. Notice that this branch touches the code in your bikeshare.py file, while the documentation branch touches the docstrings in your file. This means you can work on these branches simultaneously without any conflicts! This is a common practice in the real world.

**Merge Branches**

Finally, once you are finished with your work, you can merge both branches to the master branch, and push it back up to the remote repository.

**Submit the Project**

To complete this project, you will provide all the Git commands you used throughout this course in this [template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DoNBEQJyGHi0qAWpMpQM9lU9_VKh8ubdOY2BmKdvZcc/edit) along with a link to your repository on GitHub.
