### Project 2

Use Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States - Chicago, New York City, and Washington. You will write code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. You will also write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics. 

**Statistics Computed**

You will learn about bike share use in Chicago, New York City, and Washington by computing a variety of descriptive statistics. In this project, you'll write code to provide the following information:

**1) Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)**

- most common month
- most common day of week
- most common hour of day

**2) Popular stations and trip**

- most common start station
- most common end station
- most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)

**3) Trip duration**

- total travel time
- average travel time

**4) User info**

- counts of each user type
- counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
- earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)
